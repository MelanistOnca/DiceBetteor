# DiceBetteor
WDI Project 1

**Start** with a single 2 sided dice(coin), 2 players, 3 rounds. **Later** make number of dice, sides, players, and rounds configurable. **Later later,** "create your own game" to allow users to make one player choose a target number and number of dice while the other player chooses the side number. Maybe allow combinations of sides? Will also need to determine that target number is possible based on number of dice specified.
